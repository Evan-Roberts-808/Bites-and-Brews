They are a popular street food and appetizer in Italy. The name 'arancini' translates to 'little oranges' in Italian, referring to their shape and golden color. The main ingredient in arancini is risotto rice, which is cooked with broth and seasoned with saffron for flavor and vibrant color. Once the risotto has cooled, it's formed into balls, stuffed with a filling such as mozzarella cheese, peas, or meat ragù, and coated in breadcrumbs. The arancini are then fried until golden and crispy. They are best enjoyed while still warm, with the cheese melting in every bite. Arancini are a delightful treat that combines the richness of risotto with the convenience of a handheld snack.",
